# Unite Us

Unite Us is a React application for submitting a mock Assistance Request form.

## `Description`

Unite Us makes a GET request to a mock API at port 49567/api/service-types, which stores the available service types for assistance requests.

If all required sections of the form are complete and valid, a user is able to submit the request and a success or error message is returned, at random. A user cannot make the same request after a successful response is returned. Requests are not persisted.
